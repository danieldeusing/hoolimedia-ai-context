My Pet Hooligan is a brand and project of AMGI, a desktop and console PvP video game built in Unreal Engine 5.0 that takes place in a proprietary Metaverse called The Rabbit Hole, which itself is part of an even bigger Metaverse called Interloop.
It started with a collection of 8.888 NFT Pet Hooligans that are posed to defend Web 3.0 from the corporate overlord, MetaZuckBot.
Objective is to build a multiplayer beta game, which will be a giant Hooligan Party - It’s a combination of blockchain technology, gaming and animation creating innovative products and providing fun digital experiences.
The Rabbit Hole is more than a game: it is an immersive experience that brings together Web 3.0 technology, gaming and proprietary tools developed by the AMGI Studios to enhance the physical to digital experience. The Rabbit Hole is the first immersive social Metaverse platform for connecting as much as it is for playing popular games.
So, here it is where all the fun happens: a gated city in the Metaverse, owned and controlled by MetaZuck Corp., which means that these Hooligans aren’t completely free - at least not yet - but, while this freedom does not come, the Rabbit Hole is the place to live: running, dancing, fighting robots (and each other sometimes), interacting and living the Hooli way. As soon as the game version 2.0 comes, these Bunnies are going to have many more “extra activities” to engage in, like “Capture the Bag” and “Karrot Games”, as well as new open places in the city to discover. The Rabbit Hole is constantly expanding.
In play-to-earn games, previously mentioned as "extra activities" and coming with version 2.0 approximately end of Q4 2022, Hooligans can earn karrots and riot in the streets, fighting against MetaZuckBot to end the centralized Metaverse.
We currently do not know much about MetaZuck. Things we can assume is that MetaZuck is the CEO of MetaZuck Corp. and MetaZuckBots seem to be his evil helpers. MetaZuck Corp. for now has to be considered as an evil corporation!
While, we do not know the all details, we know that the corporation used to hold the Bunnies to harvest karrots and as their test subjects. Rumor has it that those 8.888 Bunnies escaped from the claws of MetaZuck into the Rabbit Hole. With the Rabbit Hole being fenced off and guarded with towers, it must be assumed that the Rabbit Hole is owned by MetaZuck but the rabbits have taken control. This seems to be the reason why the Bunnies are fighting ZuckBots.
